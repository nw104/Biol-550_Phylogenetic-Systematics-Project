# The coevolution of Rickettsial endosymbionts and their tick vectors

The genus Rickettsia consists of gram-negative bacteria vectored by hematophagous arthropods
(Salje et al. 2021). Out of the 1407 known human pathogens, at least 60% are known to have
zoonotic origin (Jones et al. 2018). Every year, zoonotic diseases are responsible fro about 1
billion cases and millions of deaths worldwide (Karesh et al. 2012). Between 2004-2016 a total
of 491,671 cases of tick-borne diseases were reported in the United States, which is about 76.5%
of all vector borne diseases (VBD) ((Karim et al. 2021).
The tick family Ixodidae is the most common vector for vector borne zoonotic diseases,
transmitting 40% of emerging vector borne diseases, and are the primary vector of Rickettsia
(Swei et al. 2020). In addition to the transmission of pathogenic Rickettsia, ticks also harbor
beneficial species. Rickettsia monacensis strain Humboldt, an endosymbiont to Ixodes pacificus
was found to have a 100% prevalence, a transmission of efficiency of 100% for both transstadial
and transovarial, as well as participate in nutrition based symbiosis with its host (Bodnar et al.
2018; Bodnar et al. 2020). Other endosymbionts have been documented in other tick species
including Ixodes lividus (Rickettsia vini) and Dermacentor andersoni (Rickettsia peakcockii)
(Simser et al. 2001; Nováková et al. 2018).
Coinfections of pathogenic Rickettsia and endosymbionts for ticks may impact the success of
pathogen transmission (Paddock et al. 2022). The close association between tick species and
their endosymbionts implies the need for codependence. The development of such relationships
may reveal the existence of a evolutionary relationship between ticks and certain species of
Rickettsia.
Using the ompA, gltA, and or the 16s rRNA genes I will conduct a phylogenetic analysis of
Rickettsial endosymbionts. For the different tick’s species, I will conduct a phylogenetic analysis
using the 16s rRNA mitochondrial gene. After tree construction, a comparison of both trees may
reveal the coevolutionary history between tick species and their endosymbionts.
